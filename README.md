# advent-of-rust
Advent of Rust is a project that contains my solutions for the "Advent of Code" (currently only 2021)

## What is Advent of Code?
Advent of Code is an advent calender for developers. In december, there is a new coding puzzle every day until Dec. 25th. For more information and to participate, head over to: https://adventofcode.com

## Why Rust?
I started learning Rust about two months ago, and this event is a good opportunity to learn Rust better. Even if I won't complete every day (or I just have code that doesn't work), it's worth it as this project still gives experience.

## How to run the code?
I'll upload a complete cargo project for every day, so you can select the day you want and you should be able to run it within its folder (head to the folder of the day you want and run it).
