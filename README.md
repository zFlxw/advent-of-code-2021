# advent-of-rust
Advent of Rust is a project that contains my solutions for the "Advent of Code" (currently only 2021)

## What is Advent of Code?
Advent of Code is kind of an advent calender for developers. In December there is a new coding puzzle every day until Dec. 25th. For more information and to participate, head over to: https://adventofcode.com

## Why Rust?
I started learning Rust about two months ago, and this event is a good opportunity to learn Rust better. Even if I won't complete every day (or I just have code that doesn't work), it's worth it as this project still gives experience.
